## What is neure?

`neure` is a **library-only** Rust crate that hosts an OpenAI-compatible (and Anthropic Messages v1) HTTP inference server inside any Rust embedder process. It's designed for AI user-avatars / agent systems / Tauri desktop shells / Flutter mobile apps that need a full inference stack (LLM + TTS + ASR + Rerank + Embedding + Vision) without standing up a separate daemon.

The wire format is byte-for-byte OpenAI / vLLM / ollama / llama.cpp / Anthropic SDK compatible, so any client that already works with those services will work with neure unchanged.

## At a glance

| Surface | Endpoints |
|---|---|
| **OpenAI-compatible** | `POST /v1/chat/completions`, `POST /v1/audio/speech`, `POST /v1/audio/transcriptions`, `POST /v1/embeddings`, `POST /v1/rerank`, `POST /v1/vision/{detect,classify,segment,pose}`, `POST /v1/vision/lora/{register,unregister}`, `GET /v1/vision/lora/list`, `GET /v1/models`, `POST /v1/models/pull`, `GET /v1/catalog/sources` |
| **Anthropic Messages v1** | `POST /v1/messages` (vision, tool_use, cache_control, extended thinking, streaming SSE) |
| **Liveness** | `GET /health`, `GET /v1/info` |

## Why a library, not a binary?

Most inference servers (vLLM, ollama, llama.cpp server) are standalone daemons — they bind a port, you point clients at it. That's the right model for shared GPU servers. It's the wrong model for embedding into a desktop app or mobile binary:

- **Tauri 2 desktop shell**: each Tauri app should ship neure as part of its binary, not spawn a sidecar.
- **Flutter mobile (via cargo-ndk)**: neure becomes a shared library loaded by a Kotlin/Swift shim.
- **Server-side process**: any HTTP gateway or orchestrator agent that already has its own main loop.

`neure::run_embedded(NeureEmbedConfig { port: 8085, ... })` returns a `NeureHandle` that owns the axum server's lifetime. The host calls `handle.request_shutdown()` + `handle.join().await` for graceful drain. Drop the handle without shutdown and you leak the bind port — so the type system enforces correct lifecycle.
