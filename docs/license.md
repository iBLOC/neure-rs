## Third-party attributions

neure embeds or links against the following projects. Their respective licenses are retained where required by upstream terms; none of these licenses impose copyleft obligations on the neure source tree.

## Model weights

neure does not redistribute model weights. Weights are loaded at runtime from the user's chosen model source (HuggingFace, hf-mirror, ModelScope, or a local directory). Each weight set is governed by its own license:

- **Qwen / Llama / Phi / Mistral / ChatGLM (LLM)**: Apache-2.0 / MIT (per-model)
- **Whisper (ASR)**: MIT
- **VoxCpm (TTS)**: Apache-2.0
- **MiniLM-L6-v2 (embedding)**: Apache-2.0
- **BGE / mxbai / jina (rerank)**: MIT
- **Cohere (rerank hosted)**: governed by Cohere's API terms
- **YOLOv8 / RT-DETR / DETR / RF-DETR / Florence-2 / Grounding DINO (vision)**: per-model (most are Apache-2.0 / MIT; some Ultralytics-trained weights are AGPL-3.0)

Users are responsible for downloading weights from their respective sources and complying with each model's license terms. neure does not enforce weight licensing — it loads whatever weights the user points it at.

## Why Apache-2.0?

Apache-2.0 was chosen for neure because:
- It's a permissive license (no copyleft) that allows downstream use in any project, including commercial closed-source products
- It includes an explicit patent grant (no surprise patent assertions against users)
- It's widely understood and accepted in the Rust ecosystem
- It plays well with both permissive (MIT, BSD) and weak copyleft (MPL, LGPL) dependencies

Compared to GPL-family licenses (GPL-2.0, GPL-3.0, AGPL-3.0), Apache-2.0 imposes no obligation on derivative works to be open-source. This matters for embedding neure into commercial products (Tauri desktop apps, server-side processes, mobile binaries).

## Trademark

"neure" is the project name. The neure contributors do not claim trademark rights over the name; you may use it freely in your derived products, provided you don't claim official endorsement.

## Contributing

By submitting a pull request to the neure repository, you agree to license your contribution under the same Apache-2.0 terms as the rest of the project. The project follows the standard [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/) — sign off your commits with `git commit -s` to certify that you have the right to submit the contribution.
